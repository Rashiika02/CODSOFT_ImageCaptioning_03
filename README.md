# CODSOFT_ImageCaptioning_03
Image Captioning with PyTorch
<br>This repository contains a basic implementation of an image captioning system using PyTorch. The system combines a pre-trained image recognition model (ResNet) for feature extraction with a custom LSTM-based model for generating captions.

<br>OVERVIEW
<br>The project demonstrates the following key components:

<br>Feature Extraction: Uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract features from images.
<br>Caption Generation: Employs an LSTM-based model to generate textual descriptions based on the extracted image features.
<br>Requirements
<br>Python 3.7 or higher
<br>PyTorch
<br>torchvision
<br>PIL (Python Imaging Library)
<br>NumPy

<br>Usage
<br>Prepare Your Image:
<br>Place your image file in the project directory or specify the path to the image.

<br>Run the Script:
<br>Execute the script to extract features from an image and generate a caption:

<br>Code Explanation
<br>image_captioning.py: The main script that handles feature extraction using ResNet and caption generation using a custom LSTM-based model.

<br>Feature Extraction: The extract_features function uses ResNet to extract image features.
<br>Caption Generation: The generate_caption function (currently a placeholder) should be replaced with actual code to generate captions from the trained model.
<br>CaptioningModel Class: Defines the LSTM-based architecture for generating captions.
